# Random DateTime

Get randomized datetime objects. The plugin always you to add time-unit wise limitations to the randomized datetime objects. For example, Randomized DateTime where time is between 7 to 10 PM.

## Why?

I was working on my flutter project [Rem](https://github.com/ThisIsSidam/rem-reminds-you) and needed to get randomized dateTime objects. I could have used [Random_Date](https://pub.dev/packages/random_date) but it focused on random dates, and didn't have option to limit time.

## More to come

- Option for generating random datetime including times of the past.
